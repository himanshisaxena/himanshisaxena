## Research/Projects

- **YouTube Spam Comment Detection-**

**Technologies:** Python, Text representation techniques (Bag of words and
TF-idf)

This project was part of machine learning course in masters, with a goal to do
an exploratory data analysis on given set of real comments by computation,
distribution of unique words and visualization to classify if comment maybe
marked as spam or not.

- **ReadBook (Crowd Sourcing for Book content Availability)**

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, SQL, WordPress

The idea of Read Book is to extract point of interest from texts and to make
them easily accessible to everyone. These could be summaries or analyses,
theorems, or links with other texts. In a broad sense, our system aims to
convert information contained in large publications into concise, precise, and
easily accessible points.

**Contribution:** Analysis, design and coding for web-based user interface of
application.

- **Voice Controlled Chess Board**

**Technologies:** Chatbot Dialogflow

This project was developed to showcase enhanced Next generation user interface
design with automated chess board, capable of taking voice commands from user
and translating them into physical moves on board with help of XY Plotter.

**Contribution:** Analysis, design and integration of conversational user
interface to allow translation of provided voice command to appropriate
parameters and pass it to backend for further processing on physical board to
move chess pieces.

- **Master Thesis**

**Title:** Enhancing learning experience with Augmented Reality Mind maps

**Technologies:** AR Core, Java, AR markers and QR detection

This thesis was undertaken to study the effectiveness of mind mapping over
traditional note-taking techniques and explore the benefits offered by physical
and digital mind maps. Also, a comparative analysis was performed on available
tools in the market to develop a solution that intends to bridge the gap between
physical and digital mind maps. A prototype of augmented reality based mobile
application was also developed as part of this thesis. The application enabled
users to enrich physical mind maps with digital information â€“ text, images, and
hyperlinks to enhance the learning experience of the user.
